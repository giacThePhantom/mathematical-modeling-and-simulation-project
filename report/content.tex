\begin{abstract}
	In this report we present a number of models describing neuronal dynamics.
	Firstly we present a simple leaky integrate-and-fire model, a fully deterministic representation of the neuron, which equates it to a single resistance-capacitance circuit.
	The ability of generating spikes in this model is hard coded posing a threshold on the membrane potential.
	This model is then expanded as to model supra-threshold dynamics, adding to the model a new state variable, the inter-spike time, allowing to model time-dependent changes in the systems parameter.
	The deterministic model is expanded again to model spike-rate adaptation and synaptic transmission.
	The deterministic representation of the model doesn't allow to explore channels dynamics, so we introduce a piecewise stochastic representation for the model.
	The neuron is then modelled as an hybrid system in which the voltage evolves deterministically in between stochastic channel events.
	We implemented two representation for the stochastic model: the random time change and Gillespie's direct method.
	Finally we explored how these two representation differs and propose a methodology to fit them to experimental data.

\section{Coupling, variance reduction and parametric sensitivities}
The random time change formalism can be used to develop new and faster computational methods with no loss in accuracy coupling two processes in order to reduce the variance and increase the speed of different natural estimatore.
Consider for example the computation of parametric sensitivities, which is a tool that allow to determine parameters to which a system output is most responsive.
Suppose that the intensity or propensity functions are dependent on some vectors of parameters $\theta$.
$\theta$, in our case, includes the membrane capacitance, the underlying number of channels of each type, the reversal potentials, the maximal conductance and the input current. We investigated how sensitively the average firing rate depends on $\theta$ for family of models $(V^\theta, X^\theta)$, parameterized by $\theta$ is considered, with stochastic equations:

$$\frac{d}{dt}V^\theta(t) = f(\theta, V^\theta(t), X^\theta(t))$$

$$X^\theta(t) = x_0^\theta + \sum\limits_kY_k\biggl(\int_0^t\lambda_k^\theta(V^\theta(s), X^\theta(s))ds\biggr)\zeta_k$$

Where $f$ is some function and all other notation is as before.
Some quantities depend on the entire sample path.
Let $g(\theta, V^\theta, X^\theta)$ be a path functional capturing the quantity of interest.
In order to evaluate the relative shift in expectation of $g$ due to a perturbation of the parameter vector, the estimation would be:


\begin{align*}
	\tilde{s} &=\epsilon^{-1}\mathbb{E}\bigl[g(\theta', V^{\theta'}, X^{\theta'})-g(\theta, V^\theta, X^\theta)\bigr]\approx\\
						&\approx\frac{1}{\epsilon N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\bigl[g(\theta', V_{[i]}^{\theta'}, X_{[i]}^{\theta'})-g(\theta, V_{[i]}^\theta, X_{[i]}^\theta)\bigr]
\end{align*}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\epsilon= ||\theta-\theta'||$.
	\item $(V_{[i]}^\theta, X_{[i]}^{\theta})$ is the $i$th path generated with parameter $\theta$.
	\item $N$ is the number of sample paths computed for the estimation.
\end{itemize}

A finite difference and Monte Carlo sampling could be used to approximate the change in expectation.
If the paths $(V_{[i]}^{\theta'}, X_{[i]}^{\theta'})$ and $(V_{[i]}^\theta, X_{[i]}^{\theta})$ are generated independently, the variance of the estimator for $\tilde{s}$ is $O(N^{-1}\epsilon^{-2})$ and its standard deviation $O(N^{-\frac{1}{2}}\epsilon^{-1})$.
In order to reduce the confidence interval of the estimator to a target level of $\rho >0$:

$$N^{-\frac{1}{2}}\epsilon^{-1}\lesssim\rho\Rightarrow N \gtrsim\epsilon^{-2}\rho^{-2}$$

Which can be prohibitive.
Reducing the variance of the estimator can be achieved coupling the processes $(V_{[i]}^{\theta'}, X_{[i]}^{\theta'})$ and $(V_{[i]}^\theta, X_{[i]}^{\theta})$ so that they are correlated by constructing them on the same probability space.
Different approach to this problem are discussed in the next sections.

In our case, ${\theta}$, includes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The membrane capacitance.
	\item The underlying number of channels of each type.
	\item The reversal potentials.
	\item The maximal conductance and the input current.
\end{itemize}

So:

$$\theta = \begin{pmatrix} C & N_{K} & N_{Ca} & \vec{E} & \vec{g} & s\end{pmatrix}$$

We specifically investigated how the average firing rate ($g$) for 5 sample paths changes as a result of the variation of number of potassium and calcium channels.
To do so we built a vector of $\theta$, $\Theta$, changing for each element the values of

$$N_K = [1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]$$

And

$$N_{Ca} = [1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]$$

To estimate the sensitivity of the models with regards to the change of the number of channels, we compared the two processes measuring the $\tilde{s}$ function for each couple:

$$\tilde{s}(\theta_i, \theta_j) = (g(\theta_i, V, X), g(\theta_j, V, X): \theta_i, \theta_j\in \Theta$$

Then, to uncover the sensitivity with respect to each channel we summed over the variations of the other one and averaged over each step increase:

$$\tilde{s}_{N_k[i], N_k[i+1]} = \langle\tilde{s}(\theta_{N_k[i]}, \theta_{N_k[i+1]})\rangle$$

Then we computed the average sensitivity for each step increase as:

$$S_K = \langle\tilde{s}_{N_k[i], N_k[i+1]}\rangle = \frac{1}{11}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{10}\tilde{s}_{N_k[i], N_k[i+1]}$$

Analogously for $N_{Ca}$.

	\subsection{The common random number method}
	The common random number CRN method simulates processes according to Gillespie representation with the same Poisson process $Y$ and the same stream of random variables $\{\epsilon_i\}$. For this method:

	$$S_{K} = 0.079$$
	$$S_{Ca} = -0.013$$

 	\subsection{The common reaction path method}
	The common reaction path method CRP simulates both processes according to the same random time change representation with the same Poisson processes $Y_k$.
	One stream of uniform random variables for each reaction channel is created and used for the simulation of both processes. For this method:


	$$S_{K} = 0.077$$
	$$S_{Ca} = -0.019$$

\section{Discussion}
\label{section:discussion}

In this report we present the random time change representation and the Gillespie representation as useful methods for computational neuroscience simulations of the Morris-Lecar model. We focus specifically on the suprathreshold regime of the Morris-Lecar model, in which the applied current puts the system above the Hoph bifurcation marking onset of oscillations: spiking is not the result of noise-facilitated release. \\

The Gillespie representation can be extended in this case to take into account ion channels driven by the time-varying membrane potential. On the other hand, the random time change simulation allows for generalization of computational methods developed in the context of biochemistry, in which the propensities depend upon the state of the jump process only, so that variance reduction strategies become feasible. The random time change approach avoids several approximations: for example in simulation algorithms based on a fixed time step chemical Langevin approach, it is necessary to assume that the increments in channel state are Gaussian distributed over an appropriate time interval. The random time change representation extends naturally to scenarios in which each channel has a greater number of states. \\

A closer look to the data reported in \ref{section:comparison}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item reveals that both types of simulations are behaving as expected, with the potassium channels being more sensitive than the calcium ones to the variations of parameters (the number of maximum channels for each channel type) in both types of simulations, justifying the planar approximation of the Morris Lecar model.
	\item shows how the Gillespie simulation seems to be more sensitive to the variations of number of channels, both both types of channels.\\
	\item opens up to the possibility of introducing variance reduction strategies and parameter optimization
\end{itemize}

It's important to also highlight that the algorithms presented in this report are applicable beyond the effects of channel noise on the regularity of action potential firing in a single compartment neuron model. Exact simulation of hybrid stochastic models have been used to study spontaneous dendritic NMDA spikes and intracellular growth of the T7 bacteriophage.
