\section{Comparison of the Random Time Change and Gillespie representations}

We compared the two representations running simulations that used different numbers $S_{i} = M_{tot} = N_{tot}$ with

$$S = [1, 10, 50, 100]$$

The output of the simulations was the time evolution of the voltage $V$, the number of open potassium channels $N$ and the number of open calcium channels $M$, for each type of representation.

The way of comparing the representations involved generating heatmaps having 1000 binned values of the voltage as the $x$ axis and $k + 1 = M_tot + 1 = N_tot  + 1$ values on the $y$ axis. 

Each cell of the heatmap represented the number of times a certain value of number of channels of a certain type appeared for that interval of binned voltage, summed over the other channel type. 

The images generated by the aformentioned process are available in \ref{appendix}.
